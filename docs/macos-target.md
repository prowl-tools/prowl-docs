# macOS Target (Experimental)

Prowl can drive **native macOS apps** — including menu bar extras (`NSStatusItem` + `NSMenu`) — through Apple's Accessibility API, in addition to the web. You point `target.type` at `macos`, write the same portable steps you already know, and Prowl runs them against a real app instead of a browser page.

:::warning Experimental
This target is **experimental**. The macOS code path ships in every `prowl-tools` install, but its Swift helper binary, `prowl-macdriver`, is **not yet distributed as a signed release**. The `prowl macdriver install` command exists (added in **0.1.7**), but until the first signed helper release is cut it returns a clear "no release yet — build from source" error. **Building the helper from source is the working path today** (see [Requirements](#requirements)); you can also point `PROWL_MACDRIVER_BIN` at a binary you built. The API, selector dialect, and step coverage may still change, and the target stays experimental until the two-minute signed install lands.
:::

## Requirements

- **macOS 13 or newer** (the helper's platform target).
- A **Swift toolchain** — Xcode or the Xcode Command Line Tools — to build the helper from source (the working path today).
- A **source checkout** of the [`prowl`](https://github.com/prowl-tools/prowl) repository only to build `prowl-macdriver`. Install the CLI normally from npm with `npm install -g prowl-tools`; a source checkout is not required for CLI installation.
- **Accessibility** permission for the terminal that hosts Prowl — and **Screen Recording** permission too, if your hunt takes screenshots. See [Permissions](#permissions).

## Enabling it

### 1. Get the helper

The macOS target is powered by a small Swift helper, `prowl-macdriver`, that talks to the Accessibility API.

**Build it from source (the working path today).** The signed, prebuilt helper has not been released yet, so build it once from a source checkout of the `prowl` repo:

```bash
cd macdriver
swift build -c release
```

To point at a binary you built elsewhere, export `PROWL_MACDRIVER_BIN`:

```bash
export PROWL_MACDRIVER_BIN="/path/to/prowl-macdriver"
```

**The `prowl macdriver` commands (0.1.7).** Prowl ships two subcommands for managing the helper:

```bash
prowl macdriver install   # download + verify + install the signed helper
prowl macdriver status    # show the resolved binary, versions, and permissions
```

`prowl macdriver install` will download the pinned, signed, notarized helper from GitHub Releases, verify its checksum and Developer ID signature, and install it under `~/.prowl/macdriver/<version>/` — **once the first signed release is cut**. Until then it exits with a clear message pointing you back to the source build:

```text
No published prowl-macdriver release for macdriver-vX.Y.Z yet.
The signed binary is cut by the maintainer; until then build from source:
  cd macdriver && swift build -c release
```

`prowl macdriver status` reports which binary resolved and how, the installed versions, whether the binary runs, and Accessibility / Screen Recording guidance — useful for confirming your source build is picked up.

Prowl resolves the helper in this order:

1. `$PROWL_MACDRIVER_BIN` — an absolute path to a prebuilt binary, if set;
2. the user install at `~/.prowl/macdriver/<version>/prowl-macdriver` (once `prowl macdriver install` can run);
3. the repo-local source build (`macdriver/.build/release` then `macdriver/.build/debug`).

If none exist, Prowl fails with a clear message that leads with `prowl macdriver install` and names the source build as the contributor fallback.

### 2. Point your config at a macOS target

```yaml
# .prowl/config.yml
target:
  type: macos
  app: com.example.MyMenuBarApp   # bundle id, or an absolute /path/to/App.app
```

### 3. Grant permission and run

[Grant Accessibility permission](#permissions) to your terminal, then run a hunt exactly as you would for the web:

```bash
prowl run my-macos-hunt
```

## Configuration

The `target` block carries a **discriminant**, `type`:

| `target.type` | Required fields | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `web` (default) | `url` | The original web target. `type` is optional, so existing `target: { url }` configs are unchanged and keep defaulting to web. |
| `macos` | `app` | A **bundle id** (e.g. `com.example.App`) or an absolute path to an `.app` bundle. `url` is **not** accepted on this target. |

```yaml
target:
  type: macos
  app: com.example.MyMenuBarApp
```

:::note
`url` and `app` are mutually exclusive: the `macos` branch rejects `url`, and a target with neither `url` nor a macOS `app` fails config validation with a union error. Your existing web configs are unaffected — omitting `type` still selects the web target.
:::

### App-launch timeout

`browser.timeout` (default `30000` ms) does double duty on this target: besides bounding page-style operations, it also bounds how long Prowl waits for the target app to **launch and become ready**. Raise it for apps that are slow to start.

### guardrails.allowedApps

`allowedApps` is the native-scope analog of `allowedDomains` — it restricts which app a hunt may drive.

```yaml
guardrails:
  allowedApps:
    - com.example.MyMenuBarApp
  forbiddenSelectors:
    - "Quit"
```

- An **empty or omitted** `allowedApps` list leaves the scope unset, and the target app is implicitly allowed — mirroring the way `allowedDomains` auto-includes the web target's own host.
- When `target.app` is an **app path**, an entry in `allowedApps` may match the exact `.app` path, the bundle **name** (`Example` for `Example.app`), or the bundle **id** read from `Contents/Info.plist` when that file is readable.
- `forbiddenSelectors` still applies on this target, using the same case-sensitive substring semantics as the web target — a handy guard against destructive menu items like `Quit`.

`prowl login` and the `allowedDomains` / URL guardrails do **not** apply on the macOS target.

## Selector dialect

Native selectors address accessibility identifiers, roles, and labels. Prefer `id=` (an accessibility identifier) — it is the native analog of `data-testid`.

| Selector | Matches |
|---|---|
| `id=openSettings` | element whose `AXIdentifier` equals `openSettings` |
| `role=button[name="Save"]` | an `AXButton` whose title / description / value contains `Save` |
| `label="Email"` | element whose accessibility label equals `Email` |
| `text="Save"` or bare `Save` | element whose title / description / value contains the text |
| `statusItem` | opens the app's menu bar status-item menu (and leaves it open) |
| `menu=<title>` | opens the status menu and clicks the item whose title contains the text |

The last two are **menu bar magic selectors**:

- **`statusItem`** presses the app's menu bar extra to open its status menu and leaves it open, so subsequent steps can act on the revealed items.
- **`menu=<title>`** opens the status menu and clicks the item whose title **contains** `<title>` (case-insensitive) — a one-step shortcut for "open the menu, then click this item".

```yaml
# Open the menu bar extra, then click an item by its role/name
- click:
    selector: statusItem
- click:
    selector: role=menuItem[name="Preferences…"]

# Or do both in one step
- click:
    selector: menu=Preferences…
```

## Step compatibility

Portable steps run on **both** targets. Web-only steps in the top-level hunt are **rejected up front** at validation time on the macOS target — with a friendly error — before anything launches. A `runHunt` step validates its referenced hunt when that step executes, before the nested hunt starts.

| Portable (web **and** macOS) | Rejected on macOS |
|---|---|
| `click`, `fill`, `type`, `press` | `navigate`, `waitForUrl`, `waitForNetworkIdle` |
| `wait`, `waitForSelector` | `mockRoute` / `unmockRoute` |
| `assert: visible` / `notVisible` | `evalScript`, `runScript` |
| `screenshot`, `assertScreenshot`, `assertWithAI` | `onDialog`, `select` / `selectOption` |
| `hover`, `scrollTo` | `setInputFiles`, `waitForDownload` |
| `repeat`, `if`, `runHunt`, `copyText` | `scroll` (directional), `assert: urlIncludes` / `urlEquals` |

Most rejected steps are **web-only** and produce this error:

```text
Step "navigate" is not supported by the macOS target. It is web-only;
use a portable step (click, fill, type, press, wait, assert visible, screenshot, etc.).
```

Directional **`scroll`** is the exception — it is *not* web-only (it runs on the [Android](/android) and [iOS](/ios) touch targets as a swipe), but there is no macOS accessibility equivalent, so it is rejected here with its own message pointing you at `scrollTo` (which macOS *does* support, via `AXScrollToVisible`). `hover` and `scrollTo` are both portable on macOS.

## Assertions on the macOS target

Use **inline** `assert: visible` / `notVisible` steps for mid-flow checks. URL assertions (`urlIncludes` / `urlEquals`) are web-only and are rejected.

As of **0.1.7**, hunt-level `assertions:` blocks **run** on this target: `selectorExists` / `selectorNotExists` are evaluated against the app (and pass through `guardrails.forbiddenSelectors` first), while web-only assertion types (`urlIncludes`, `urlEquals`, `noConsoleErrors`, `noNetworkErrors`) are reported as `skipped` rather than dropped. See [Assertions](/assertions#hunt-level-assertions).

:::warning Use a recognized engine prefix in assertions
In an `assert: visible` / `notVisible` value, anything **without a recognized selector prefix is treated as text to match**. The recognized prefixes on this path are `text=`, `id=`, and `role=` (plus `css=` / `xpath=`). Notably, **`label=` is _not_ recognized here** — `visible: "label=Email"` is matched as the literal text `label=Email`, not as a label selector.

So in assertions, write `text="Settings"`, `id=statusLabel`, or `role=staticText[name="Settings"]`. Reserve `label=` for interaction steps like `click` and `fill`, where the native selector parser does understand it.
:::

```yaml
# Good — matched as a text selector
- assert:
    visible: text="Settings"

# Also fine — plain prose is matched as text
- assert:
    visible: "Settings"
```

## The `press` key vocabulary

As of **0.1.7**, `press` on the macOS target accepts the web target's full key vocabulary (previously it mapped only `Enter` / `Return` / `Space`):

- **Named keys:** `Escape`, `Tab`, `Backspace`, `Delete`, `Home`, `End`, `PageUp`, `PageDown`, the arrows (`ArrowUp` / `ArrowDown` / `ArrowLeft` / `ArrowRight`), and `F1`–`F12`.
- **Single printable characters** (layout-independent).
- **Modifier combos** joined with `+`, using `Control` / `Shift` / `Alt` / `Meta` (with `Ctrl` / `Option` / `Cmd` / `Command` aliases) — e.g. `Meta+s`, `Control+a`, `Shift+Tab`.

Key names are matched case-insensitively, and an unknown key fails with a category summary of what's supported.

```yaml
- press:
    selector: id=searchField
    key: "Meta+a"          # select-all in the focused field
- press:
    selector: id=searchField
    key: "Escape"
```

A bare `Enter` / `Return` / `Space` still takes the deterministic, focus-independent `AXPress` fast path when the element supports it. Every other key activates the target app, focuses the resolved element, and posts real `keyDown` / `keyUp` events to the app's process — so keystrokes can never land in another application. No extra permission is required beyond the Accessibility grant.

## Known limitations

This is an early implementation. Today:

- **Screenshots are full-screen.** The `screenshot` / `assertScreenshot` steps use macOS `screencapture`, which grabs the **whole screen** (not a window-scoped image), and therefore need **Screen Recording** permission.
- **`hover` moves the real mouse cursor** to the target element, rather than dispatching a synthetic hover.
- App teardown **quits the target app** after the run.

## Permissions

macOS gates Accessibility and Screen Recording behind explicit, per-app permission.

### Accessibility

The **process that hosts** Prowl — your terminal (Terminal, iTerm, VS Code, …) or a CI agent — must be granted Accessibility permission. macOS attributes the grant to the **hosting app**, not to `prowl-macdriver`.

Grant it under **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility**, then enable your terminal app. You can preflight from the helper itself:

```bash
macdriver/.build/release/prowl-macdriver check   # prints {"trusted": <bool>}; prompts on first run
```

### Screen Recording

The `screenshot` / `assertScreenshot` steps additionally need **Screen Recording** permission for the same hosting app (**System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording**).

### CI notes (macOS runners)

Headless CI can't click "Allow" in a permission dialog, so the permissions must be **pre-provisioned** before the run:

- Grant Accessibility (and Screen Recording, if you screenshot) to the runner's **host app** ahead of time. The supported route is a **PPPC/TCC configuration profile via MDM** on a self-hosted runner. Some teams instead seed the **TCC database** (`/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db`) with `sqlite3` in their runner image — be aware that the `access` table's schema **differs across macOS versions** (a hardcoded `INSERT` from a blog post will break on another release), and **SIP blocks direct writes** to `TCC.db`, so this only works on images with SIP disabled or a shell that has Full Disk Access.

- The **target app must be installed and registered** with Launch Services on the runner so Prowl can launch it by bundle id.

:::note
GitHub-hosted macOS runners do not grant Accessibility, so the macOS target is aimed at **self-hosted / MDM-managed runners** for now.
:::

## Worked example

A minimal menu bar hunt: open the app's status menu, click **Settings**, wait for the settings window's label, and assert it's visible.

```yaml
# .prowl/config.yml
target:
  type: macos
  app: com.example.MyMenuBarApp
guardrails:
  allowedApps:
    - com.example.MyMenuBarApp
  forbiddenSelectors:
    - "Quit"
```

```yaml
# .prowl/hunts/settings-window.yml
name: settings-window
steps:
  - click:
      selector: menu=Settings
  - waitForSelector:
      selector: text="Settings"
      timeout: 10000
  - assert:
      visible: text="Settings"
```

```bash
prowl run settings-window
```

The `menu=Settings` selector opens the menu bar extra and clicks the **Settings** item in one step; `waitForSelector` then waits for the settings window's `Settings` label to appear before the inline assertion confirms it's visible.

## Testing a macOS app in CI

Driving a real macOS app needs a graphical login session and pre-granted Accessibility (and, for screenshots, Screen Recording) permission — which **GitHub-hosted macOS runners do not provide**. So macOS hunts run on a **self-hosted / MDM-managed runner** you control.

**One-time runner setup:**

1. Register a self-hosted macOS runner that runs in a **logged-in GUI session** (not a headless daemon).
2. **Pre-provision permissions** for the runner's *host app* (the shell/agent that launches Prowl) — see [Permissions](#permissions). The supported route is a **PPPC/TCC configuration profile via MDM**; grant Accessibility, plus Screen Recording if hunts screenshot.
3. Make the **target app** installed and registered with Launch Services so Prowl can launch it by bundle id.
4. Provide the helper. Until the signed release lands, build it once and expose it via `PROWL_MACDRIVER_BIN` (see [Get the helper](#1-get-the-helper)).

A minimal hunt (≤20 lines) — open the app's menu, open Settings, assert it appeared:

```yaml
# .prowl/hunts/macos-smoke.yml
name: macos-smoke
steps:
  - click:
      selector: menu=Settings
  - waitForSelector:
      selector: text="Settings"
      timeout: 10000
  - assert:
      visible: text="Settings"
```

A workflow on the self-hosted runner (permissions already provisioned). Because this runner has desktop permissions, trigger it only from trusted code paths such as protected-branch pushes or manual dispatches on the `main` branch; do not run privileged self-hosted macOS jobs on untrusted `pull_request` code:

```yaml
name: macOS E2E
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches: [main]
permissions:
  contents: read
jobs:
  macos:
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: [self-hosted, macOS]
    env:
      PROWL_MACDRIVER_BIN: ${{ github.workspace }}/prowl-source/macdriver/.build/release/prowl-macdriver
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.sha }}
          persist-credentials: false
      - name: Check out Prowl helper source
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          repository: prowl-tools/prowl
          path: prowl-source
          persist-credentials: false
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - name: Build the macOS helper
        run: (cd prowl-source/macdriver && swift build -c release)
      - name: Run macOS hunts
        run: npx prowl ci --junit
      - name: Upload artifacts
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: macos-artifacts
          path: .prowl/runs/**
          if-no-files-found: ignore
```

:::note
This mirrors how the Prowl repo dogfoods its own native gates on a self-hosted Mac. Once the signed helper release ships, the "Build the macOS helper" step becomes `npx prowl macdriver install` and the `PROWL_MACDRIVER_BIN` override is no longer needed.
