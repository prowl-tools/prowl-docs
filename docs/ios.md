# iOS Simulator Target (Experimental)

Prowl can drive **native iOS apps** on a **booted iOS Simulator**, in addition to the web. You point `target.type` at `ios`, write the same portable steps you already know, and Prowl runs them against a real app in the simulator instead of a browser page.

It follows the same "external agent + JSON protocol" shape as the [macOS](/macos-target) and [Android](/android) targets: `xcrun simctl` handles simulator lifecycle and screenshots, and the on-simulator [WebDriverAgent](https://github.com/appium/WebDriverAgent) (Apache-2.0) handles UI interaction over its W3C-shaped HTTP/JSON API driven with raw `fetch`.

:::warning Experimental — simulators only
The iOS target shipped in Prowl **0.1.5** and is **experimental**. Its API, selector dialect, and step coverage may still change. **Real iOS devices are out of scope** (tracked as PROWL-062 in the CLI repo) — the target drives **booted simulators only**.
:::

## Requirements

- **macOS with a full Xcode** (not just the command-line tools) installed and selected (`xcode-select -p`), so `xcrun simctl` and `xcodebuild` are available.
- At least one **booted simulator** — check with `xcrun simctl list devices | grep Booted`, or boot one with `xcrun simctl boot <udid>` (or from Xcode).

### The one-time WebDriverAgent build

UI interaction is handled by [WebDriverAgent](https://github.com/appium/WebDriverAgent) (Apache-2.0). Its runner is built **once** from the `appium-webdriveragent` npm dependency with `xcodebuild build-for-testing`, then cached under:

```text
~/.prowl/wda/<wda-version>-xcode<xcode-version>/
```

The cache key includes the WDA **and** Xcode versions, so the build is reused across runs and rebuilt only when either changes. The first run prints a one-time "building WebDriverAgent…" notice and can take a few minutes. Simulators need **no code signing**.

:::note iOS 26+ launch path (0.1.6)
As of **0.1.6**, Prowl hosts WebDriverAgent through the standard XCTest host launch — `xcodebuild test-without-building` driven by the generated `.xctestrun`, with the dynamic WDA port injected into the runner's environment — instead of `simctl launch` of the preinstalled xctrunner. This is the single launch path and works on iOS 18 and iOS 26+ alike (on iOS 26+ the old approach was terminated by RunningBoard for missing entitlements). The build cache and the `PROWL_WDA_RUNNER` override are preserved.
:::

To skip the build entirely — for example in CI with a cached runner — set `PROWL_WDA_RUNNER`. It may point at the generated **`.xctestrun`**, its **`Build/Products`** directory, or the runner **`.app`**:

```bash
export PROWL_WDA_RUNNER="/path/to/WebDriverAgentRunner-Runner.app"
# or a .xctestrun file, or the Build/Products directory that contains it
```

### The on-simulator agent

The runner above is the [`appium-webdriveragent`](https://github.com/appium/WebDriverAgent) npm dependency. As of Prowl 0.1.5 it is an **`optionalDependency`** (pinned to `appium-webdriveragent@16.4.0`). Default `npm install -g prowl-tools` installs it, so the iOS target works out of the box. A lean, web-only install can skip it:

```bash
npm install -g prowl-tools --omit=optional   # skips the mobile agents
```

If an iOS hunt runs without the agent present, Prowl fails with a clear message and the exact command to restore it:

```bash
# Global install (matches `npm install -g prowl-tools`):
npm install -g appium-webdriveragent

# Local project install:
npm install appium-webdriveragent
```

## Enabling it

Point your config at an iOS target:

```yaml
# .prowl/config.yml
target:
  type: ios
  app: "com.example.App"          # a bundle id, or a path to a built .app to install
  # udid: "ABCD-1234"             # optional; required only when several simulators are booted
  # coldStart: true               # optional; uninstall+reinstall before launch (requires a .app path)
guardrails:
  allowedApps:                    # optional scope; empty = allow the target app
    - "com.example.App"
```

Then run a hunt exactly as you would for the web:

```bash
prowl run my-ios-hunt
```

On launch Prowl selects the booted simulator (failing with an actionable error, **listing candidates**, if several are booted and no `udid` is set), installs the app (when given a `.app`, reading its bundle id from the bundle's **root** `Info.plist`), builds/caches and installs the WebDriverAgent runner, launches it on a **dynamically allocated** port (passed via `SIMCTL_CHILD_USE_PORT` so parallel sessions and CI jobs don't collide), launches the target app, and waits for WDA to report ready. Everything is torn down (WDA session, `simctl terminate` of the runner and the app) after the run.

## Configuration

The `target` block carries a **discriminant**, `type`. On the iOS target:

| Option | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | `"ios"` | yes | Selects the iOS simulator target. |
| `app` | `string` | yes | A **bundle id** (e.g. `com.example.App`) or a path to a **built `.app`** to install. |
| `udid` | `string` | no | The simulator UDID. **Required only when several simulators are booted** — selection otherwise fails with an error listing the candidates. |
| `coldStart` | `boolean` | no (default `false`) | When `true`, **uninstall + reinstall** before launch for a deterministic start. **Requires the `.app` path** (a bare bundle id cannot be reinstalled). |

`url` is **not** accepted on this target. Omitting `type` still selects the web target, so existing web configs are unchanged.

:::note `.app` path vs bundle id
A bare `target.app` ending in `.app` is treated as a **bundle id** unless a directory of that name exists on disk, so bundle ids like `com.company.app` are not mistaken for paths.
:::

### guardrails.allowedApps

`allowedApps` is the native-scope analog of `allowedDomains` — it restricts which app a hunt may drive.

```yaml
guardrails:
  allowedApps:
    - "com.example.App"           # a bundle id…
    - "/abs/path/to/App.app"      # …or a .app path
```

- An **empty or omitted** `allowedApps` list leaves the scope unset, and the target app is implicitly allowed — mirroring the way `allowedDomains` auto-includes the web target's own host.
- Entries are **iOS bundle ids** or **`.app` paths**. A `.app` path is authorized by its path, its bundle **name**, or the **bundle id** read from the bundle's root `Info.plist`.
- `forbiddenSelectors` still applies, using the same case-sensitive substring semantics as the web target.

`prowl login` and the `allowedDomains` / URL guardrails do **not** apply on the iOS target.

## Selector dialect

Native selectors address accessibility ids, labels, visible text, and element type. Semantics match the macOS and Android targets, so a selector means the same thing across native targets. Prefer `id=` (set `accessibilityIdentifier` in your app — the native analog of `data-testid`).

| Selector | Matches |
|---|---|
| `id=save` | element whose accessibility id (`accessibilityIdentifier`) is `save` |
| `label="Submit"` | element whose `accessibilityLabel` equals `Submit` (exact — compiles to a `label ==` NSPredicate) |
| `role=XCUIElementTypeButton` | element of that type (shorthand `role=Button` works too) |
| `role=Button[name="Save"]` | that type whose visible `label`/`value` contains `Save` |
| `text="Save"` or bare `Save` | element whose `label` or `value` contains the text (substring) |
| `:focus` | the element with keyboard focus (`hasKeyboardFocus == 1`) |

Text/label/role+name selectors compile to WDA NSPredicate strings (quotes and backslashes are escaped). `forbiddenSelectors` still applies on this target.

## Inspecting the UI with `prowl analyze`

Don't guess selectors — dump them. `prowl analyze` works on the iOS target the same way it does on the web and macOS: it attaches to a running app on a booted simulator, reads WebDriverAgent's UI hierarchy, and prints every interactive element with **ranked selector candidates** (best first), plus a windows list. It is read-only, honors `guardrails.allowedApps`, and leaves the app running.

```bash
# Uses the iOS target from .prowl/config.yml:
prowl analyze

# …or force the iOS target explicitly:
prowl analyze --app com.apple.Preferences --platform ios
prowl analyze --app com.example.App --platform ios --udid <SIM-UDID>   # pick a simulator

# Machine-readable output for agents:
prowl analyze --app com.apple.Preferences --platform ios --json
```

Ranking (best → last resort): `id=` (accessibility id) > `label=` > `role=<Type>[name="<text>"]` > `text=`.

:::note Platform selection and the iOS `id=` caveat
A bare bundle id is ambiguous with the macOS and iOS targets (which default to macOS unless a config `target.type` or `--platform` says otherwise), so pass `--platform ios`. With an iOS `target.type` in `.prowl/config.yml`, a bare `prowl analyze` needs no flag. WDA's page source exposes a single `name` attribute (the accessibility identifier when set, else the label), so `id=` is only offered when `name` differs from the label.
:::

## Step compatibility

Portable steps run on the iOS target; web-only steps in the top-level hunt are **rejected up front** at validation time — before anything launches — with a clear, iOS-labelled error. A `runHunt` step validates its referenced hunt when that step executes, before the nested hunt starts.

| Portable (iOS) | Not supported on iOS |
|---|---|
| `click`, `fill`, `type`, `press` | `navigate`, `waitForUrl`, `waitForNetworkIdle` |
| `wait`, `waitForSelector` | `mockRoute` / `unmockRoute`, `evalScript`, `runScript` |
| `assert: visible` / `notVisible` | `onDialog`, `select` / `selectOption`, `setInputFiles` |
| `screenshot`, `assertScreenshot`, `assertWithAI` | `waitForDownload`, `assert: urlIncludes` / `urlEquals` |
| `scroll`, `scrollTo` | `hover` (no touch equivalent) |
| `repeat`, `if`, `runHunt`, `copyText` | |

The web-only rejection names the offending step, for example:

```text
Step "navigate" is not supported by the iOS target. It is web-only;
use a portable step (click, fill, type, press, wait, assert visible, screenshot, etc.).
```

Notes:

- **`type` and `fill`** set text on the focused / matched field via WDA's `element/value`.
- **`press`** supports a small, honest key set and rejects other keys with the supported-keys message:
  - `enter` / `return` and `delete` / `backspace` / `del` — sent through WDA's key endpoint to the focused element;
  - `home` — returns to the springboard.
- **Screenshots are captured with `simctl`** (not WDA), so `screenshot` / `assertScreenshot` artifacts still work even if the agent wedges.
- **`scroll` and `scrollTo`** work as of **0.1.8**, synthesized as touch swipes through WDA's W3C actions endpoint. Directional `scroll`'s optional `amount` is the swipe distance in **device points** (default 75% of the axis; a negative amount reverses direction); `scrollTo` runs a **bounded swipe-loop probe** (downward, then upward) and fails with an error naming the selector and attempt count if the element never appears. A matching hierarchy element must also pass WDA's `/displayed` check before `scrollTo`, `waitForSelector`, or inline visible/notVisible treat it as visible. See [Step Types](/step-types#scroll).
- **`hover`** has no touch-device equivalent and is rejected with a clear message. (On the macOS target `hover` is portable — the rejection is specific to touch targets.)
- URL assertions (`urlIncludes` / `urlEquals`) are web-only; use inline `assert: visible` / `notVisible` steps for checks on this target.
- Hunt-level `assertions:` blocks **run** on this target as of **0.1.7**: `selectorExists` / `selectorNotExists` are evaluated against the app, while web-only assertion types (`urlIncludes`, `urlEquals`, `noConsoleErrors`, `noNetworkErrors`) are reported as `skipped`. See [Assertions](/assertions#hunt-level-assertions).

## Worked example

Open the iOS Settings app, assert a known row is visible, and screenshot it:

```yaml
# .prowl/config.yml
target:
  type: ios
  app: "com.apple.Preferences"
guardrails:
  allowedApps:
    - "com.apple.Preferences"
```

```yaml
# .prowl/hunts/settings-smoke.yml
name: settings-smoke
steps:
  - waitForSelector:
      selector: label="General"
      timeout: 10000
  - assert:
      visible: label="General"
  - screenshot: settings-home
```

```bash
prowl run settings-smoke
```

## Continuous integration

macOS runners ship Xcode and the iOS simulator runtimes. Boot a simulator with `xcrun simctl`, and cache the one-time WebDriverAgent build (`~/.prowl/wda/`, keyed on the WDA + Xcode versions) so subsequent runs skip the ~2-minute `xcodebuild`.

```yaml
name: iOS E2E
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  ios:
    runs-on: macos-15
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build

      # Cache the built WebDriverAgent runner across runs.
      - name: Cache WebDriverAgent
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: ~/.prowl/wda
          key: prowl-wda-${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles('package-lock.json') }}

      - name: Boot a simulator
        run: |
          xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 16" || true
          xcrun simctl bootstatus "iPhone 16"

      - name: Run hunts against the simulator
        run: npx prowl ci --junit

      - name: Upload artifacts
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: ios-artifacts
          path: .prowl/runs/**
          if-no-files-found: ignore
```

The Prowl repo also runs a self-hosted end-to-end gate (`.github/workflows/mobile-e2e.yml`) that boots a simulator on the Prowl Tools Mac and drives Settings through the real CLI, skipping cleanly for forks.
